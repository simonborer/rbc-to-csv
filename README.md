# Formatting data from a bank account

RBC's "export to CSV" is broken, so I'm using a console script (for chequing) and a bash script (for cc because the semantics are wrecked for cc).

I don't know why I need to say this, because it should be obvious, but you have to get the data into your browser on your own - there's nothing insecure about this.
